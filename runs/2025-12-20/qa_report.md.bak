QA_RESULT: FAIL

# QA Report — 2025-12-20 — ch001

## Hard Failures
- rule: artifact_missing: manuscript
  evidence: Missing E:/Lianghuagit/xiaoshuo/manuscript/ch001.md
  fix: Generate `manuscript/chNNN.md` first.
- rule: artifact_missing: chapter_plan
  evidence: Missing E:/Lianghuagit/xiaoshuo/runs/2025-12-20/chapter_plan.md
  fix: Generate `runs/YYYY-MM-DD/chapter_plan.md` before QA.

## Warnings
- topic: chapter_id_check_skipped
  evidence: Missing E:/Lianghuagit/xiaoshuo/manuscript/ch001.md so chapter-id consistency not verified.
  suggestion: Generate manuscript and re-run QA.

## Open Loop Verification
- planned_advances: []
- chapter_plan_path: E:/Lianghuagit/xiaoshuo/runs/2025-12-20/chapter_plan.md
- summary_path: E:/Lianghuagit/xiaoshuo/recap/chapter_summaries/ch001.md
- state_patch_path: E:/Lianghuagit/xiaoshuo/state/state_patch.json

## Recommended Rework Steps (if FAIL)
1) Fix missing artifacts (chapter_plan / manuscript / summary / patch).
2) Ensure chapter_plan advances >=2 open_loops and cites their ids.
3) Update summary + state_patch so each planned loop id is explicitly present.
4) Re-run: `python tools/continuity_checks.py --date 2025-12-20 --chapter ch001`
